# Speech_Recognition

## About
The Emotion Detection System using Audio Features is a machine learning project built with Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, and PyAudio that focuses on recognizing and classifying emotions from audio recordings. This system has a wide range of potential applications, from analyzing speech sentiment in customer service interactions to assisting in mental health monitoring through voice analysis.

### Key Features
- **Audio-based Emotion Analysis:** Detect and classify emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, from audio recordings.

- **Real-time Analysis:** Perform real-time emotion recognition from live audio streams or analyze pre-recorded audio data.

### How it Works
The system employs deep neural networks and advanced audio processing techniques to extract relevant features from audio data. These features are then used to classify the emotional state of the speaker. TensorFlow is used for deep learning tasks, Librosa aids in audio feature extraction, and PyAudio facilitates real-time audio input.

### Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the developers behind TensorFlow, Librosa, and PyAudio for making this project possible.
